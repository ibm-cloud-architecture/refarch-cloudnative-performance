# refarch-cloudnative-performance
As any reference architecture will be successful if it is widely adopted and used in production, it is esseintal to make sure the architecture is performing and scaling. This project provides guidance on how to characterize the performance of cloud native Microservice application. This repositoty will have Performance Topology details, performance test scripts and utilities. This project will look 3 main goals as shown below

*  Characterize the performance of the reference architecture End to End
*  Evaluate the performance of various technologies (for example, Springboot with Netflix OSS vs. Amalgam8 etc.,)
*  Come up with best practices to improve performance and scalability of the microservice applications
